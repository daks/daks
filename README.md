### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ã‰ric!

I'm a senior System Engineer DevOps / SRE.  
As such, I write code but not that much in public or on Github so don't expect a lot of activity here.

I have used Saltstack a lot over the past ten years and contributed to the community work on formulas, you can see part of this work on my repositories.  
Previously, I also developed some Python/Django code but very few code is visible here.
